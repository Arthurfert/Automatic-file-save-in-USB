# Automatic-file-save-with-USB

Compare file versions between a PC and a flash drive (USB) for automatic merging.

## Precise desciption

This project aims to automatically merge the files on your USB flash drive with the files on your computer.

You can choose which folders you want to sync and which you don't.

The goal is to create a **secure recognition process** to ensure that it is **your** USB and not someone else's, and then merge both drives without any action.

If the project goes well, a long-term goal would be to have an app that controls which files to merge and which not to merge, and to make it easier to attach new USB drives.
