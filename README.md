# Automatic-file-save-with-USB

Compare file versions between a PC and a flash drive (USB) for automatic merging.

## Precise desciption

This project aims to automatically merge the files on your USB flash drive with the files on your computer.

> *Folder sized merging planned*

The goal is to create a **secure recognition process** to ensure that it is **your** USB and not someone else's, and then merge both drives without any action.

If the project goes well, a long-term goal would be to have an application that controls which files to merge and which not to merge, and to make it easier to attach new USB drives.
